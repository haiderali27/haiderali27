- 👋 Hi, I’m @haiderali27
- 👀 I’m interested in Machine Learning, Robotics and problem solving. I like to solve things differently and like to have new perspective about a problem by percieving it differently. I like to combine different ideas to create a new one. I like to connect different ideas by comparing similarities and differences in them. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Machine Learning and Robotics. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the problems that will improve my skills.
- 📫 How to reach me, well this is my email => haideraliprofessional@gmail.com
